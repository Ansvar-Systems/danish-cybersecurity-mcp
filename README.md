# Danish Cybersecurity MCP

<!-- ANSVAR-CTA-BEGIN -->
> **The Danish cybersecurity corpus is now served through the Ansvar Gateway.** Connect your AI assistant (Claude, Copilot, Cursor, custom MCP client) to `https://gateway.ansvar.eu/mcp` — one OAuth connection, free tier available, covering this corpus plus EU regulations, national law across dozens of audited jurisdictions (Europe + the US), and CVE/security intelligence, every result with a verbatim source citation. Start at https://ansvar.eu/docs/quickstart

### Connect

**Claude Code** (one line):

```bash
claude mcp add ansvar --transport http https://gateway.ansvar.eu/mcp
```

**Claude Desktop / Cursor** — add to `claude_desktop_config.json` (or `mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ansvar": {
      "type": "url",
      "url": "https://gateway.ansvar.eu/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude.ai** — Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector → paste `https://gateway.ansvar.eu/mcp`

First request opens an OAuth signup flow (setup details: [ansvar.eu/docs/quickstart](https://ansvar.eu/docs/quickstart)). After signup, your client is bound to your account; tier (free / premium / team / company) determines fan-out, quota, and which downstream MCPs are reachable.

## Self-host this MCP

You can also clone this repo and build the corpus yourself. The schema,
fetcher, and tool implementations all live here. What is not in the repo is
the pre-built database — TDM and standards-licensing constraints on the
upstream sources mean we host the corpus on Ansvar infrastructure rather
than redistribute it as a public artifact.

Build your own: run this repo's ingestion script (entry-point varies per
repo — typically `scripts/ingest.sh`, `npm run ingest`, or `make ingest`;
check the repo root).

## Data Sources and Freshness

All content is sourced from official Danish regulatory publications:

- **CFCS (Centre for Cyber Security)** -- Official regulatory authority

### Data Currency

- Database updates are periodic and may lag official publications
- Freshness checks run via GitHub Actions workflows
- Last-updated timestamps in tool responses indicate data age

See `sources.yml` for full provenance metadata.

| **Semgrep** | SAST scanning (OWASP top 10, secrets, TypeScript) | Every push |
| **Gitleaks** | Secret detection across git history | Every push |
| **Trivy** | CVE scanning on filesystem and npm dependencies | Daily |
| **Docker Security** | Container image scanning + SBOM generation | Daily |
| **Socket.dev** | Supply chain attack detection | PRs |
| **Dependabot** | Automated dependency updates | Weekly |
